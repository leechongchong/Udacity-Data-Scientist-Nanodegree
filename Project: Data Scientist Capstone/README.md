# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms
## Project Motivation
The risk of fraudulent credit card fraud has become one of the problems plaguing the credit card sector of global banks. Taking the United States as an example, the Federal Reserve's payment investigation report shows that in 2012, the total amount of credit card payments in the United States reached 26 billion US dollars, of which unauthorized credit card payments, that is, the amount of fraudulent credit cards, was as high as 6.1 billion US dollars. Measuring the risk of credit card transactions involves a complex range of techniques, from finance to economics to law to information science. Traditional credit card fraud detection requires a lot of manpower to analyze and judge. Human auditors will call to confirm whether the transaction is suspected of credit card fraud. Now, due to the surge in transaction volume, the credit card departments of major banks are relying on big data to quickly identify suspected fraudulent credit card transactions through machine learning and cloud computing methods.

This project aims to explore basic applications of machine learning in credit card fraud detection. Computer programming and mathematical models are used to construct the main characteristics of credit card fraud, and machine learning methods are used to automatically identify credit card transactions suspected of fraud, and finally generate an intelligent program for real-time monitoring of credit card fraud, and strive to obtain instructive conclusions for practice.

### Libraries
pandas \
is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.

time \
provides various time-related functions.

matplotlib.pyplot \
is a state-based interface to matplotlib. It provides an implicit, MATLAB-like, way of plotting. It also opens figures on your screen, and acts as the figure GUI manager.

sklearn \
is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.

xgboost \
belongs to a family of boosting algorithms and uses the gradient boosting (GBM) framework at its core. 

pydotplus \
is an improved version of the old pydot project that provides a Python Interface to Graphviz's Dot language
